            <div class="meta">Series introduction • Chapter 0</div>
            <p>Most people think mathematics is numbers, equations, or formulas that belong in classrooms and exams. But let me tell you — <strong>math is much deeper.</strong></p>
            <p>Math is <em>logic in disguise</em>. It’s the way nature organizes itself, the way choices shape destiny, the way beauty hides in proportions. It’s not just something you solve on paper — it’s something you live every single day.</p>
            <p>Look around you: the symmetry in a flower, the rhythm of your heartbeat, the chance of winning or losing, the growth of a tree. Mathematics is the code of reality.</p>

            <h2>1. Algebra is Balance</h2>
            <div class="meta">Chapter 1 • Algebra</div>
            <p>Life is an equation. Every decision, every consequence, every trade we make — it all comes down to balance.</p>
            <p>Algebra isn’t about solving for “x.” It’s about learning that if you add weight to one side of the scale, you must adjust the other.</p>
            <p>Think about it: if you spend money, you must earn it back. If you give trust, you expect loyalty in return. If you eat without care, your health must balance the cost. Algebra teaches us fairness — it teaches that life is give and take.</p>
            <p><em>When we solve for “x,” we’re not just finding a number — we’re finding the missing piece of balance in a situation.</em></p>
            <p class="small">“An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God.” – Ramanujan</p>

            <h2>2. Probability is Life’s Gamble</h2>
            <div class="meta">Chapter 2 • Probability</div>
            <p>Every morning when you step out the door, you’re rolling dice. Will it rain? Will you succeed? Will the risk pay off?</p>
            <p>Probability is not numbers — it’s destiny whispering in percentages. A coin toss reminds us: sometimes life is 50/50. A lottery shows us: some outcomes are possible, but not likely. Insurance is built on this truth: we live in probabilities, not certainties.</p>
            <p>The beauty of probability is that it humbles us. It says: “You are not in control of outcomes, only of choices.” Life is not about guaranteeing success — it’s about increasing the odds. When we understand probability, we learn to embrace risk, calculate wisely, and walk boldly into uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>3. Calculus & Growth</h2>
            <div class="meta">Chapter 3 • Calculus</div>
            <p>Nothing grows in straight lines. Not economies, not relationships, not even trees. Calculus is the mathematics of change — of acceleration, growth, and decay.</p>
            <p>Derivatives tell us the rate of change — how fast something is moving, improving, or decaying. Integrals tell us the total impact — the accumulation of all those small steps.</p>
            <p>In life, calculus teaches patience. Because growth is slow at first, then sudden. Decay is invisible, until it’s undeniable. Calculus reminds us: the present is just a snapshot. The real truth is found in the trend.</p>

            <div class="meta">Chapter 4 • Geometry</div>
            <p>Look closely at a snowflake, a seashell, or the spiral of a galaxy. Geometry is everywhere.</p>
            <p>Triangles, circles, spirals — nature builds with shape, not chance. Bees build hexagons — the most efficient way to store honey. Architects design arches — geometry that resists gravity. Artists chase the golden ratio — a geometry of beauty.</p>
            <p>Geometry is more than drawing shapes in a notebook — it’s the blueprint of the universe. When we study geometry, we’re unlocking how nature thinks: how it saves energy, how it balances strength and beauty.</p>

            <h2>5. Infinity & Beyond</h2>
            <div class="meta">Chapter 5 • Infinity</div>
            <p>Infinity is not just a number — it’s a paradox. It’s the horizon we chase but never touch. Count as high as you want — there’s always more. Divide as small as you can — there’s always smaller.</p>
            <p>Infinity humbles us because it reminds us of our limits. But it also inspires us — because it shows that imagination has no ceiling. Infinity is why mathematicians lose sleep, and why philosophers dream.</p>

            <div class="meta">Chapter 6 • Statistics</div>
            <p>Numbers don’t lie — but people can twist them. Statistics is about finding truth in the blur of chaos. Polls measure opinions. Medicine tests cures. Businesses chase trends. Statistics helps us see the forest, not just the trees.</p>
            <p>But it also warns: be careful. Numbers can be framed. The wise learn to read between the percentages.</p>

            <div class="meta">Chapter 7 • Sequences</div>
            <p>Life repeats itself. Seasons turn. Days cycle. Generations echo. Sequences are not just numbers in a row — they are existence unfolding. Fibonacci spirals in sunflowers. Rhythms in music. Daily routines.</p>
            <p>Recognizing sequences teaches us rhythm, discipline, and foresight. It shows us that while life feels random, patterns hide everywhere.</p>

            <div class="meta">Chapter 8 • Logic</div>
            <p>Without logic, thought collapses. It is the backbone of mathematics, and the immune system of reason. Logic strips away emotion, bias, and illusion. It forces us to test truth with structure.</p>
            <p>Logic may sound cold — but it’s liberating. It doesn’t tell us what to think — it teaches us how to think.</p>

            <div class="meta">Chapter 9 • Set Theory</div>
            <p>At its core, set theory is about belonging. This belongs here. That does not. Some things overlap. It’s simple, yet powerful. Sets build categories, and categories build knowledge.</p>
            <p>From the clothes in your wardrobe to the ideas in your mind — set theory is quietly organizing your life.</p>

            <div class="meta">Chapter 10 • Number Theory</div>
            <p>Numbers are not just tools — they are mysteries. Prime numbers hide secrets. The golden ratio shapes beauty. Modular arithmetic runs cryptography. Number theory is less about utility and more about wonder.</p>
            <p>It’s where math feels closest to poetry, and numbers sing instead of calculate.</p>

            <p>A butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil, and a tornado rises in Texas. Chaos theory is not disorder — it’s fragile order. Small inputs cause massive ripples.</p>

  <h2>📖 Math Stories & Legends</h2>

  <article id="perfect-odd-number">
    <h3>1. The Perfect Odd Number That Never Was</h3>
    <p>For centuries, mathematicians have hunted a phantom: the perfect odd number. A perfect number is one where the sum of its factors equals itself (like 28 = 1+2+4+7+14). We’ve found even ones. But no odd perfect number has ever been found. Thousands of years, countless minds, computers searching in silence — and still, nothing. Math whispers: maybe it doesn’t exist. Or maybe it hides, waiting for the one who’ll prove it.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="fermat">
    <h3>2. Fermat’s Last Theorem — The Margin Mystery</h3>
    <p>In the 1600s, Pierre de Fermat scribbled in the margin of a book: “I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, but this margin is too small to contain it.” The claim? That the equation <strong>xⁿ + yⁿ = zⁿ</strong> has no solutions for <strong>n > 2</strong>. For 350 years, the world chased that “marvelous proof.” It took Andrew Wiles in 1994, with modern maths, to finally prove it true. But Fermat’s little margin note still feels like a taunt from history.</p>

  <article id="riemann">
    <h3>3. The Riemann Hypothesis — The Music of the Primes</h3>
    <p>Prime numbers are the heartbeat of maths — but they pulse unpredictably. Bernhard Riemann, in 1859, wrote one paper, a whisper about how primes might actually dance to a hidden rhythm. That whisper became the Riemann Hypothesis — the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics. To this day, no proof, no disproof. Just mystery. Some say, solving it could shake cryptography, finance, and the internet itself.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="ramanujan">
    <h3>4. Ramanujan’s Dream Numbers</h3>
    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan, a self-taught genius from India, claimed that goddess Namagiri whispered formulas in his sleep. He filled notebooks with identities that still astonish modern mathematicians. G.H. Hardy once said visiting him was like walking with a man from another world. Ramanujan reminds us: sometimes maths feels less like science, more like revelation.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="collatz">
    <h3>5. The Collatz Conjecture — The Simple Question that Eats Giants</h3>
    <p>Take any number. If it’s even, divide it by 2. If it’s odd, triple it and add 1. Repeat. No matter what number you start with, you always seem to end at 1. Simple, right? But no one has ever proved why it always works. Paul Erdős said: “Mathematics is not ready for such problems.” A child can play it. A genius can’t solve it.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="godel">
    <h3>6. Gödel’s Incompleteness — The Limits of Truth</h3>
    <p>In 1931, Kurt Gödel shattered mathematics with one idea: no system can ever prove all truths about itself. He built a proof so strange it basically says, “This statement cannot be proved.” If it’s true, it can’t be proved. If it’s false, it becomes true. Paradox, wrapped in logic. Gödel showed us that even maths — our most solid ground — has cracks.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="hilbert">
    <h3>7. Hilbert’s Infinite Hotel</h3>
    <p>David Hilbert once described a hotel with infinite rooms. Even if it’s full, you can still make space for more guests. Shift everyone one room forward: Room 1 → Room 2, Room 2 → Room 3 … and Room 1 is free. Infinite rooms, infinite paradoxes. It’s a story that plays with infinity itself — a reminder that maths can bend reality.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="konigsberg">
    <h3>8. The Seven Bridges of Königsberg</h3>
    <p>In 18th-century Prussia, the city of Königsberg had seven bridges. People wondered: Can you walk through the city crossing each bridge exactly once? Leonhard Euler proved it was impossible — and in doing so, he birthed graph theory, the backbone of networks, the internet, and modern logistics. A city walk gave birth to a whole new world of maths.</p>

  <article id="cantor">
    <h3>9. Cantor and the Infinities</h3>
    <p>Georg Cantor blew minds in the 1800s. He showed not all infinities are equal. The infinity of counting numbers: 1, 2, 3… The infinity of real numbers (all decimals) — way, way bigger. For revealing this, many of his peers mocked him. Some even said he was insane. Today, his theory is the foundation of modern set theory. Cantor proved: infinity itself has levels.</p>

  <article id="four-color">
    <h3>10. The Four Color Theorem</h3>
    <p>Imagine coloring a map so that no two neighboring countries share the same color. How many colors do you need? In 1852, Francis Guthrie guessed the answer: just four. For over a century, nobody could prove it. Finally in 1976, computers helped solve it — the first major theorem proved by machine. A puzzle on a map became a turning point in how humans and machines collaborate.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="zeno">
    <h3>11. Zeno’s Paradoxes — Can Achilles Catch a Tortoise?</h3>
    <p>The Greek philosopher Zeno argued motion was impossible. If Achilles gives a tortoise a head start in a race, by the time Achilles reaches where the tortoise was, the tortoise has moved further. This repeats forever. Achilles never overtakes. Of course, in reality, he does — but Zeno’s paradox forced mathematics to invent calculus centuries later to explain motion.</p>

  <article id="millennium">
    <h3>12. The $1,000,000 Problems</h3>
    <p>In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute listed 7 Millennium Problems — unsolved questions in mathematics, each worth $1,000,000. Only one has been solved (Poincaré Conjecture, by Grigori Perelman). He refused the prize. Six remain: including the Riemann Hypothesis and Navier–Stokes. They’re not just maths problems. They’re treasure maps.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="perelman">
    <h3>13. Grigori Perelman — The Reluctant Genius</h3>
    <p>Perelman solved the impossible Poincaré Conjecture in 2003. The world showered him with awards and millions. He rejected them all, disappearing into obscurity. His reason? “I’m not interested in money or fame. I know how to control the universe. So tell me, why should I run for a million?” A modern legend — a hermit who beat one of the hardest problems, then walked away.</p>

  <article id="pythagoras">
    <h3>14. The Pythagorean Secret — Numbers Have Souls</h3>
    <p>The Pythagoreans weren’t just mathematicians; they were a cult. They believed numbers ruled the cosmos. Odd = male. Even = female. Ten = perfection (the holy tetractys). But then they discovered irrational numbers (like √2). A number that could not be written as a fraction. It shook their faith so badly, legend says they tried to keep it secret — and one who revealed it was drowned at sea. Numbers weren’t just math. They were divine.</p>
  </article>

  <article id="egyptian">
    <h3>15. The Egyptian Rope-Stretchers</h3>
    <p>Long before textbooks, Egyptians used ropes knotted at 12 equal parts to form right angles — the 3-4-5 triangle. This was how they aligned temples and pyramids with precision. Their builders weren’t just workers. They were mathemagicians, stretching ropes to catch the geometry of the gods.</p>

  <article id="babylonian">
    <h3>16. The Babylonian Tablet of π</h3>
    <p>On a clay tablet called Plimpton 322 (1800 BC), Babylonians recorded right triangles with stunning accuracy — essentially trigonometry, 1,000 years before the Greeks. They approximated π as 3.125. Crude? Maybe. But it built the walls of Babylon. A reminder: maths was survival before it was theory.</p>

  <article id="archimedes">
    <h3>17. Archimedes and the Burning Mirrors</h3>
    <p>Archimedes, the Greek genius, supposedly designed mirrors to focus sunlight and burn Roman ships. True or not, it shows how maths, geometry, and imagination created legends of power. Archimedes himself once said: “Give me a place to stand, and I will move the earth.”</p>

  <article id="zero">
    <h3>18. Zero — The Ghost Number</h3>
    <p>For centuries, civilizations feared zero. Nothingness was terrifying. Romans had no symbol for it. Greeks distrusted it as “void.” It was in India that zero was embraced as a number. From there, it spread through the Arabs into Europe. Without zero, no computers, no modern maths. What was once feared became the foundation of everything.</p>

    <h3>19. The Golden Ratio — Mathematics of Beauty</h3>
    <p>From the spirals of seashells to the Parthenon in Greece, from Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man to sunflower patterns — the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) has been seen as the fingerprint of harmony. To some, it’s divine proportion. To others, it’s a coincidence we can’t stop seeing everywhere. Either way, it whispers that beauty itself might be mathematical.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I’ve always believed this — <strong>mathematics is not numbers.</strong> It is not just equations, nor the algorithms we grind through in class. For me, mathematics is <em>logic in motion</em>. It is the hidden rhythm of the universe, the quiet voice that says: “Look deeper, the world has patterns, and truth leaves traces.”</p>
      <p>So this space is mine — and yours. A place where we talk math not as a subject, but as a philosophy of living. Where every principle is more than a formula, it’s a story.</p>
